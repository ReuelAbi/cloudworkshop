**Getting Started with Swagger**
==================
Swagger is a professional way to publish your REST API's.

 - To see an example of the IoT Service API's published using the Swagger API go [here](https://markreha.github.io/cloudworkshop/sdk/docs/swagger/site/index.html) or [here](https://markreha.github.io/cloudworkshop/sdk/docs/swagger/index.html).
 - The 'swagger-api.json' file located in this repository was built using the Swagger Online Editor. The Swagger Online Editer can be found [here](http://editor.swagger.io). To experience the tool and get practice documenting your API's you can import the Swagger API file that is found in this repository into the Swagger Online Editor.
 - You can use Swagger UI to publish an online web site for your API's. The Swagger UI can be found [here](https://swagger.io/swagger-ui/). The site [here](https://markreha.github.io/cloudworkshop/sdk/docs/swagger/site/index.html) was built using the Swagger UI.
