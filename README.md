**Getting Started with the Cloud Workshop SDK**
==================
The Cloud Workshop SDK contains all the documentation, tools, and sample template applications required to build a simple, scalable, Cloud based suite of IoT applications.

SDK Contents
--------
This SDK is organized into a number of folders. It should be noted that all directories in this markup are indicated in ***bold italic*** text. Note, once you have downloaded the SDK the Markdown README files can still be viewed from your file system in Chrome by using the [Markdown Preview Chrome Plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdown-preview/jmchmkecamhbiokiopfpnfgbidieafmd). If you want to report issues or suggest new features please enter an Issue in this repository.
 - The '[***developer***](#developer-directory-contents)' folder: contains starter Java Spring and PHP Laravel template projects 
 - The '[***docs***](#docs-directory-contents)' folder: contains Database, JavaDoc, PhpDoc, and Architecture documentation, you should start here 
 - The '[***tools***](#tools-directory-contents)' folder: contains misc. documentation generation tools

Getting Started
--------
You should start by first reading the Architecture decks and JavaDoc as well as the PhpDoc all located in the [***docs***](sdk/docs/development/README.md) directory in the SDK. You should also make sure you are comfortable with the following technologies, frameworks, and tools. There are many [tutorials](#tutorials) available to help you come up to speed. If you are doing development using desktop tools you will also need to [install](#development-tools-installation) all the development tools.
1)  Java, Spring Framework (Core, Security, JDBC), Maven, and JAX-RS. These technologies and frameworks will be used to build the IoT Services application.
2) Laravel PHP, LavaCharts, and Guzzle. These technologies and frameworks will be used to build the IoT Reporting application.
3) Github, SourceTree, MAMP, Eclipse Neon, MySQL Workbench, Apache Tomcat 8.5, and PostMan. These tools will be used to support building all of the IoT applications.

Development Tools Installation
--------
For desktop development you will need to download and install the following tools. If you use the Cloud based Codeenvy IDE than you will not be required to install ANY development tools!
1. Eclipse Neon for Java EE platform: Download [here](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-ee-developers/neon3) and/or use cloud based the Codenvy IDE.
2. Eclipse Neon for PHP platform: Download [here](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-php-developers/neon3) and/or use the cloud based Codenvy IDE.
3. Tomcat 8.5: Download [here](http://tomcat.apache.org/download-80.cgi) and/or use the cloud based Codenvy IDE.
4. MAMP: Download [here](https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/).
5. SourceTree: Download [here](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com) and/or use the Chrome Browser.
6. MySQL Workbench: Download [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/) and/or use the MySQL Admin Chrome Plugin, which can be dowloaded from the [Chrome WebStore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/) (search for MySQL Admin).
7. PostMan: Download [here](www.getpostman.org) and/or use the Postman Chrome Plugin, which can be dowloaded from the [Chrome WebStore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/) (search for Postman).

Next Steps
--------
After you are become familiar with the architecture, sample applications, and tools you can start building your own IoT applications using the sample Reference applications in the SDK as a guide. As a developer, there are application build instructions for developing in the Cloud based Cloudenvy IDE or desktop Eclipse Neon IDE. All code is maintained in the Github Cloud based source control system and deployed to the Cloud based OpenShift PaaS. It should be noted that there is nothing technically preventing you from deploying these application to other Clouds such as Amazon AWS. See the ['README'](sdk/docs/development/README.md) file and 'Cloud Setup Notes text' file located in the [***docs/development***](sdk/docs/development/README.md) folder to get started building your own IoT applications.

Developer Directory Contents
----------
This directory contains the contains starter Java Spring and PHP Laravel template projects. You can import these into your IDE to get the basic scaffolding for a starter IoT Services application and an IoT Reporting application.

 - ***eclipsePHP***: this folder contains the instructions and ANT build files to support auto-deployment in Eclipse PHP.
 - ***cloudapp***: this folder contains a basic PHP Laravel Project with the "Hello World" page along with the Guzzle and LavaCharts libraries added.
 - ***cloudservices***: this folder contains a basic Java Spring Project with "Test" REST API configured along with basic SLF4J configuration.
 - ***testing***: this folder contains the Postman Test Scripts that can be used when testing the Reference IoT Services application and its associated REST API's.
